In this project , We used  [EmailJs ](https://www.emailjs.com/)   to send emails and it is necessary that you create an account on the emailjs site and enter the required information
And we also used `Swagger` to create the document . I published a useful tip about this in [my Personal LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abolfazl-ghaderi-04769a290_js-typescript-nodejs-activity-7161396806608642049-vpW8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). I hope it will help you ❤️
